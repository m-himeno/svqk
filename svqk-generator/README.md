# Generator

Generator is an automatic source file generation tool. The source files generated by Generator are for applications that perform CRUD operations on tables (Frontend and Backend) or for automated tests (Integration Tests and End-to-End Tests), and are generated based on the metadata of the tables in the database.

## Usage

You can run Generator via a command or a VSCode task.

### Running via Command

Execute the following command in this project’s directory:

```sh
pnpm generate [options] [Table...]
```

Available values for `options` are as follows:

- `--component`: Specifies the type of source files to generate. Available values are `backend`, `integration-test`, `api-client`, `frontend`, `e2e-test`, and `all`. If not specified, it defaults to `all`.
- `--templateType`: Specifies the template for the source files. Available values are `skeleton` and `arch`. If not specified, the value of `templateType` in `.yo-rc.json` under this project is used. The meanings of each value are:
  - `skeleton`: The generated source files will follow the same structure as those of HelloTable.
  - `arch`: The generated source files will conform to the architecture definition and use common features under the arch package.

Specify the `Table` for which you want to perform CRUD operations. To specify multiple tables, separate them with spaces.

Upon executing the command, the source files for the specified `component` will be generated. The output directory, file names, and source code will follow the specified `templateType`.

#### Example

The following command generates a Backend for CRUD operations on the `world` table using the `skeleton` template:

```sh
pnpm generate --component backend --templateType skeleton world
```

After executing the above command, the following source files will be generated:

```txt
📁 my-artifactid-backend/src/main/java/my/group/id
  ├── 📁 domain/hello
  │   ├── 📄 WorldService.java
  │   └── 📄 WorldRepository.java
  └── 📁 interfaces/hello
      └── 📄 WorldController.java
```

### Running via VSCode Task

Open this project or the workspace in VSCode, and run the VSCode task: `generate`.  
When the task runs, prompts for `component` and `Table` will be displayed. Refer to the "Running via Command" section above for details on each.

## Customization

Generator is customizable. To customize templates, modify the files under `generators/app/templates`.  
To change tool behavior, modify `index.ts` and `types.d.ts` under `src/main`.

Generator is implemented using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/).  
Refer to the Yeoman documentation when making customizations.
